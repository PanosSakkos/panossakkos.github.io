Last time we highlighted how critical trust is in a decentralized environment
(ironically) and especially in Token Offerings. One aspect of the damaged trust
between the end users and the decentralized ecosystem is cybersecurity. A
decentralized system is usually built from many different building blocks
(subsystems) and each one of them can have a negative impact on the overall
system, when it gets compromised. A special category of building block is Smart
Contracts. Smart Contracts are executable code that runs on a decentralized
network, in an automated way. You can picture them as a vending machine that,
once it’s programmed and filled with items, will keep serving the available
items when someone drops a coin in it. Smart Contracts are the beating heart of
a decentralized system. Αny kind of bug can be fatal to the overall system,
since it will almost always have an impact on the funds of the Contract itself
and its stakeholders.

The first major Smart Contract incident was the one of the DAO, which took place
less than two months since its launch and affected 18,000 stakeholders who lost
more than 3,6 million Ether. Another severe incident was the Parity wallet hack
which resulted in more than 150,000 stolen Ether. Just these two incidents on
the Smart Contract level, had an impact on funds that are currently valued close
to $700,000,000.
