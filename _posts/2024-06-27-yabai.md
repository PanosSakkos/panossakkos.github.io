Have you thought how much time you spend managing your windows? Each time you
open a new window you have to decide where to place it and then move it or
resize it. We do it so often that we take it for granted, but what if we could
offload this task to the window manager?

Window managers that open windows in non overlapping tiles were first introduced
in 1981
[by Xerox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager#Xerox_PARC), but
they have become more popular recently. The idea is simple, when you open a new
window, the window manager will automatically size and place it in the right
position for you, without having it overlap with the other open windows of your
space. And the "right position" can be configured in order to match your
workflow and preferences.

There are plenty of tiling window managers for each OS, but more or less they
offer the same core features for managing the windows. The most popular window
placement strategy is the Binary Space Partitioning, which will halve the space
each time a new window is added, like this:

Opening more than three windows in this placement strategy is not very
practical, so in practice you should expect something like this:

There will be times that you'll want to manipulate the open windows, so here are
a few features that can prove very handy:

1. Rotating the windows on the X and Y axes:
   ![axis-rotate](/img/posts/yabai/axis-rotate.gif)

2. Maximizing the current window, in order to focus on a single task, or to
   present a window in a meeting: ![fullscreen](/img/posts/yabai/fullscreen.gif)

3. Rotating the windows in case you want to bring another window on the left
   half of the screen: ![rotate](/img/posts/yabai/rotate.gif)

4. Last, not a fancy feature but a very practical, is excluding windows from
   the  
   tiling placement, which is convenient for your utility windows that you want
   them to float above the tiled windows: ![float](/img/posts/yabai/float.png)

If you are a macOS user and want to give it a try, you can install
[yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) and
[skhd](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd) (for setting up the window
manipulation shortcuts) using brew:

```bash
brew install koekeishiya/formulae/skhd
skhd --start-service
brew install koekeishiya/formulae/yabai
yabai --start-service
```

Then edit your `.config/yabai/yabairc`:

```config
yabai -m config layout bsp
yabai -m config window_placement second_child
yabai -m config mouse_follows_focus on
yabai -m mouse_drop_action swap

yabai -m config top_padding 6
yabai -m config bottom_padding 6
yabai -m config left_padding 6
yabai -m config right_padding 6
yabai -m config window_gap 6
```

And your `.config/skhd/skhdrc`:

```config
shift + alt - r : yabai -m space --rotate 270
shift + alt - y : yabai -m space --mirror y-axis
shift + alt - x : yabai -m space --mirror x-axis
shift + alt - f : yabai -m window --toggle zoom-fullscreen
```

And restart yabai (skhd supports hot reload):

```bash
yabai --restart-service
```

_Note that the above yabai config doesn't require to disable the System
Integrity Protection_

If you like yabai and skhd, consider supporting
[koekeishiya](https://github.com/koekeishiya) who supports both projects.
