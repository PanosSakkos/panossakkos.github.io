Token offerings, also known as Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), have revolutionized the way companies can raise funds by issuing tokens to users who are willing to invest in their project.
While this process has its benefits, it has also been plagued by incidents that have eroded the trust between token issuers and potential buyers.
A 2018 study by Satis Group found that a staggering 81% of token offerings were identified as scams, with 6% failing, 5% becoming inactive, and only 8% being traded on an exchange. As a result, in 92% of cases, users lost their funds as they were unable to trade the tokens or access the issuer's services at a discount.

At Blocktopus, we recognize the need for transparency and accountability in the token offering process.
That's why we've implemented state-of-the-art security measures to ensure the safety of our users' funds.
We believe that by creating a secure and trustworthy platform, we can help restore confidence in the token offering industry and facilitate the growth of innovative blockchain projects.
