[Signal](https://signal.org/) is an encrypted chat messaging app that is
considered the state of the art from both a UX and security point of view. The
Signal Protocol, developed by the
[Open Whisper Systems](https://whispersystems.org/) team, enables seamless
end-to-end encryption of channels, including voice and media. The protocol has
been recently deployed on WhatsApp and is currently being deployed in Messenger.

As of version 2.4, Signal for [iOS](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-iOS)
supports Greek as a language. That's a small contribution I made, since I was
surprised when I noticed that my favorite chat app did not support Greek as a
language. The process was straightforward and the Signal team was very
responsive.
