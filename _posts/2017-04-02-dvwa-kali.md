Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) is a purposely insecure PHP/MySQL web
application created for security professionals, web developers, students, and
teachers to learn about web application security in a controlled environment.
The application is intended to help security enthusiasts test their skills and
tools in a legal setting and help web developers understand the process of
securing web applications. DVWA is designed to provide a simple and
straightforward interface to practice some of the most common web
vulnerabilities at various difficulty levels. It contains both documented and
undocumented vulnerabilities, which encourages users to identify as many issues
as possible.

To get started with DVWA, download the source code from GitHub and set up the
environment on Kali Linux, in order to have most of the tools you'll need
preinstalled. DVWA requires Apache and MySQL, which are already installed on
Kali Linux as well.

Download and unzip DVWA:

```bash
wget https://github.com/ethicalhack3r/DVWA/archive/master.zip -O dvwa.zip
unzip dvwa.zip
```

Start Apache and MySQL:

```bash
service apache2 start
service mysql start
```

Move DVWA to `/var/www/html` and setup permissions:

```bash
mv DVWA-master /var/www/html/dvwa
cd /var/www/html
chmod -R 755 dvwa/
```

After completing the setup, update your MySQL password in the DVWA configuration
file to create the `dvwa` database:

You can then access the login page by visiting `http://127.0.0.1/dvwa`. Make
sure to set the security level of DVWA to `low` under the 'DVWA Security' tab to
begin exploring the low-hanging fruits of web vulnerabilities:

Note that you should never expose this web application in a non-private network
and always reset the security level to `impossible`.

In the next post we'll exploit the first vulnerability of DVWA in order to login
to the application without knowing the password.
